# D.ãƒ„'s Scripts

Those are my **scripts** that I wish to share but they are to small to have their own repository.

### Starfall Scripts
| Name | Short description |
| ------ | ------ |
|**dGUI**|**Object-Oriented GUI** library made entirely in starfall with no need of additional plugins. It's made to be flexible and easy to use, has a lot similarities to derma(hovewer the goal isn't to replicate derma/gwen).|
|**FontAwesome**|Simple helper for using Font Awesome to display glyphs. |

Some important things:
- You are free to use my scripts as long as you mention me in the code.
- I may help you with usage of my scripts, hovewer **I'm not going to help you with everything or explain you basic stuff, there are lua tutorials for this.**
- Please note that this repository is used more as an container for my scripts rather than actual repository with author's support and informative commits ;).
